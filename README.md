# mmo-map
This is a very simple map for Pantheon MMO.
It will type /loc to get your coordinates. If you are typing or running, it will not work.

# Installation
Copy the contents of `pantheon-mmo-map.ps1` into notepad. Save the file as `pantheon-mmo-map.ps1` in your Donwloads folder (or whereever you like). Open PowerShell (windows-key, type PowerShell). Type `cd Downloads` and hit `enter`. type `.\pantheon-mmo-map.ps1`.

# Use
The zoom-in and zoom-out features don't work yet. Press the purple U to update your location. Press the red X to close.

# Progress
Currently, I only have Wilds End mostly mapped.
